* PR `#349 <https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator/pull/349>`_: Working files are deleted by default after an estimation batch completes.

0.3.3
-----

This release facilitates the migration of the `openff-evaluator` package from `omnia` to `conda-forge`. This mainly
involves changes which update the package to use the new namespaces introduced in the `openff-tookit` package, rather
than the old and now deprecated `openforcefield` namespaces.

Bugfixes

0.3.2
-----

This release exposes the option to disable caching of simulation data by an evaluator server. The performance of the
local storage backend is currently poor when dealing with large amounts of cached data and hence it may be preferable
to disable caching in such cases.

New Features
""""""""""""

* PR `#337 <https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator/pull/337>`_: Expose server option to dis/enable data caching.

0.3.1
-----

This release fixes a bug introduced in version 0.3.0 of this framework, whereby the default workflows for computing
excess properties could in rare cases be incorrectly merged leading to downstream protocols taking their inputs from
the wrong upstream protocol outputs.

While this bug should not affect most calculations, it is recommended that any production calculations performed
using version 0.3.0 of this framework be repeated using version 0.3.1.

Bugfixes
""""""""

* PR `#331 <https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator/pull/331>`_: Fixes merging excess properties.

0.3.0
-----

The main feature of this release is the overhauling of how the framework computes the gradients of observables with
respect to force field parameters.

In particular, from this release onwards all gradients will be computed using the fluctuation formula (also referred
to as the thermodynamic gradient), rather than calculation be the re-weighted finite difference approach (PR
`#280 <https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-evaluator/pull/280>`_). In general the two methods produce gradients
which are numerically indistinguishable, and so this should not markedly change any scientific output of this framework.

The change was made to, in future, enable better integration with automatic differentiation libraries such as
`jax <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, and differentiable simulation engines such as
`timemachine <https://github.com/proteneer/timemachine>`_ which readily and rapidly give access to
:math:`\mathrm{d} U / \mathrm{d} \theta_i`.

**Additionally**, as of version 0.3.0 'known' charges (i.e. those assigned to TIP3P water and ions) are no longer
automatically applied when using a SMIRNOFF based force field. This feature was originally included in the framework as
the OpenFF toolkit did not support defining charges on specific molecules in the force field itself. This is now fully
supported through the ``LibraryCharges`` section of a SMIRNOFF force field and hence this workaround is no longer
required. From now on all ion and water charges **must** be specified in the SMIRNOFF force field.

Finally, this release includes **beta** support for computing host-guest binding affinities using the
attach-pull-release (APR) method through integration with the `pAPRika <https://github.com/slochower/pAPRika>`_ and
`taproom <https://github.com/slochower/host-guest-benchmarks>`_ packages. This support was largely facilitated by the
efforts of the ``paprika`` authors - `David R. Slochower <https://github.com/slochower>`_ and
`Jeffry Setiadi <https://github.com/jeff231li>`_.

0.1.0 - OpenFF Evaluator
------------------------

Introducing the OpenFF Evaluator! The release marks a significant
milestone in the development of this project, and constitutes an almost
full redesign of the framework with a focus on stability and ease of
use.

**Note:** *because of the extensive changes made throughout the entire
framework, this release should almost be considered as an entirely new
package. No files produced by previous versions of this will work with
this new release.*

Clearer Branding
""""""""""""""""

First and foremost, this release marks the complete rebranding from the
previously named *propertyestimator* to the new *openff-evaluator*
package. This change is accompanied by the introduction of a new
``openff`` namespace for the package, signifying it's position in the
larger Open Force Field infrastructure and piplelines.

What was previously::

   import propertyestimator

now becomes::

   import openff.evaluator

The rebranded package is now shipped on ``conda`` under the new name of
``openff-evaluator``::

   conda install -c conda-forge -c omnia openff-evaluator

Markedly Improved Documentation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

In addition, the release includes for the first time a significant
amount of documentation for using the `framework and it's features`_ as
well as a collection of user focused tutorials which can be ran directly
in the browser.

Support for RDKit
"""""""""""""""""

This release almost entirely removes the dependence on OpenEye thanks to
support for RDKit almost universally across the framework.

The only remaining instance where OpenEye is still required is for host-guest
binding affinity calculations where it is used to perform docking.

Model Validation
""""""""""""""""

Starting with this release almost all models, range from
``PhysicalProperty`` entries to ``ProtocolSchema`` objects, are now
heavily validated to help catch any typos or errors early on.

Batching of Similar Properties
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``EvaluatorServer`` now more intelligently attempts to batch
properties which may be computed using the same simulations into a
single batch to be estimated. While the behaviour was already supported
for pure properties in previous, this has now been significantly
expanded to work well with mixture properties.

0.0.9 - Multi-state Reweighting Fix
-----------------------------------

This release implements a fix for calculating the gradients of properties being estimated by reweighting data cached from multiple independant simulations.

Bugfixes
""""""""

* PR `#143 <https://github.com/openforcefield/propertyestimator/pull/143>`_: Fix for multi-state gradient calculations.


0.0.8 - ThermoML Improvements
-----------------------------

This release is centered around cleaning up the ThermoML data set utilities. The main change is that ThermoML archive files can now be loaded even if they don't contain measurement uncertainties.

New Features
""""""""""""

* PR `#142 <https://github.com/openforcefield/propertyestimator/pull/142>`_: ThermoML archives without uncertainties can now be loaded.

* PR `#138 <https://github.com/openforcefield/propertyestimator/pull/138>`_: Fix for a typo in the maximum number of minimization iterations.


0.0.6 - Solvation Free Energies
-------------------------------

This release centers around two key changes -

i) a general refactoring of the protocol classes to be much cleaner and extensible through the removal of the old stub functions and the addition of cleaner descriptors.
ii) the addition of workflows to estimate solvation free energies via the new ``SolvationYankProtocol`` and ``SolvationFreeEnergy`` classes.

The implemented free energy workflow is still rather basic, and does not yet support calculating parameter gradients or estimation from cached simulation data through reweighting.

A new table has been added to the documentation to make clear which built-in properties support which features.

New Features
""""""""""""

* PR `#110 <https://github.com/openforcefield/propertyestimator/pull/110>`_: Cleanup and refactor of protocol classes.

Breaking Changes
""""""""""""""""

* PR `#130 <https://github.com/openforcefield/propertyestimator/pull/130>`_: The ``RunOpenMMSimulation.steps`` input has now been split into the ``steps_per_iteration`` and ``total_number_of_iterations`` inputs.

Migration Guide
"""""""""""""""

This release contained several public API breaking changes. For the most part, these can be
remedied by the follow steps:

* Replace all instances of ``run_openmm_simulation_protocol.steps`` to ``run_openmm_simulation_protocol.steps_per_iteration``


0.0.5 - Fix For Merging of Estimation Requests
----------------------------------------------

This release implements a fix for a major bug which caused incorrect results to be returned when submitting multiple estimation requests at the same time - namely, the returned results became jumbled between the different requests. As an example, if a request was made to estimate a data set using the `smirnoff99frosst` force field, and then straight after with the `gaff 1.81` force field, the results of the `smirnoff99frosst` request may contain some properties estimated with `gaff 1.81` and vice versa.

This issue does not affect cases where only a single request was made and completed at a time (i.e the results of the previous request completed before the next estimation request was made).

"""""""""""""""

This release contained several public API breaking changes. For the most part, these can be
remedied by the follow steps:

* Change all instances of ``Substance.get_amount`` to ``Substance.get_amounts`` and handle
  the newly returned frozenset of amounts, rather than the previously returned single amount.
* Replace the now removed protocols as follows:

  - ``DivideGradientByScalar`` -> ``DivideValue``
