Physical Properties
===================

A core philosophy of this framework is that users should be able to seamlessly curate data sets of physical properties
and then estimate that data set using computational methods without significant user intervention and using sensible,
well validated workflows.

This page aims to provide an overview of which physical properties are supported by the framework and how they
are computed using the different :doc:`calculation layers <../layers/calculationlayers>`.

In this document :math:`\left<X\right>` will be used to denote the ensemble average of an observable :math:`X`.

Density
"""""""

The density (:math:`\rho`) is computed according to

.. math::

    \rho = \left<\dfrac{M}{V}\right>

where :math:`M` and :math:`V` are the total molar mass and volume the system respectively.

|simulation_layer|
*******************

The density is estimated using the default :ref:`simulation workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|simulation_layer|>` without
modification. The estimation of liquid densities is assumed.

|reweighting_layer|
*******************

The density is estimated using the default :ref:`reweighting workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|reweighting_layer|>` without
modification. The estimation of liquid densities is assumed.

Dielectric Constant
"""""""""""""""""""

The dielectric constant (:math:`\varepsilon`) can be computed from fluctuations in a systems dipole moment (see Equation
7 of :cite:`2002:glattli`) according to:

.. math::

    \varepsilon = 1 + \dfrac{\left<\vec{\mu}^2\right> - \left<\vec{\mu}\right>^2} {3\varepsilon_0\left<V\right>k_bT}

where :math:`\vec{\mu}`, :math:`V` are the systems dipole moment and volume respectively, :math:`k_b` the Boltzmann
constant, :math:`T` the temperature, and :math:`\varepsilon_0` the permittivity of free space.

The framework currently computes :math:`\varepsilon` according to

.. math::

    \varepsilon = 1 + \dfrac{\left<{\left(\vec{\mu} - \left<\vec{\mu}\right>\right)}^2\right>} {3\varepsilon_0\left<V\right>k_bT}

making use of the fact that

.. math::

    \left<\vec{\mu}^2\right> - \left<\vec{\mu}\right>^2 = \left<{\left(\vec{\mu} - \left<\vec{\mu}\right>\right)}^2\right>

in order to match the `mdtraj <http://mdtraj.org/>`_ implementation which has been used in previous studies by the
OpenFF Consortium (see for example :cite:`2015:beauchamp`).

|simulation_layer|
******************

The dielectric is estimated using the default :ref:`simulation workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|simulation_layer|>`
which has been modified to use the specialized |extract_average_dielectric| protocol in place of the default |extract_average_statistic|.
The estimation of liquid dielectric constants is assumed.

|reweighting_layer|
*******************

The dielectric is estimated using the default :ref:`reweighting workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|reweighting_layer|>`
which has been modified to use the specialized |reweight_dielectric_constant| protocol in place of the default |reweight_statistics|.
It should be noted that the |reweight_dielectric_constant| protocol employs bootstrapping to compute the uncertainty in
the average dielectric constant, rather than attempting to propagate uncertainties in the average dipole moments and
volumes. The estimation of liquid dielectric constants is assumed.

Enthalpy of Vaporization
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The enthalpy of vaporization :math:`\Delta H_{vap}` (see :cite:`2011:wang`) can be computed according to

.. math::

    \Delta H_{vap} = \left<H_{gas}\right> - \left<H_{liquid}\right> = \left<E_{gas}\right> - \left<E_{liquid}\right> + p\left(\left<V_{gas}\right>-\left<V_{liquid}\right>\right)

where :math:`H`, :math:`E`, and :math:`V` are the enthalpy, total energy and volume respectively.

Under the assumtion that :math:`V_{gas} >> V_{liquid}` and that the gas is ideal the above expression can be simplified
to

.. math::

    \Delta H_{vap} = \left<U_{gas}\right> - \left<U_{liquid}\right> + RT

where :math:`U` is the potential energy, :math:`T` the temperature and :math:`R` the universal gas constant. This
simplified expression is computed by default by this framework.

    - **Liquid phase**: The potential energy of the liquid phase is estimated using the default :ref:`simulation workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|simulation_layer|>`,
      and divided by the number of molecules in the simulation box using the ``divisor`` input of the
      |extract_average_statistic| protocol.

    - **Gas phase**: The potential energy of the gas phase is estimated using the default :ref:`simulation workflow <properties/commonworkflows:|simulation_layer|>`,
      which has been modified so that

        - the simulation box only contains a single molecule.
        - all periodic boundary conditions have been disabled.
        - all simulations are performed in the NVT ensemble.
        - the production simulation is run for 15000000 steps at a time (rather than 1000000 steps).
        - all simulations are run using the OpenMM reference platform (CPU only) regardless of whether a GPU is
          available. This is fastest platform to use when simulating a single molecule in vacuum with OpenMM.

The final enthalpy is then computed by subtracting the gas potential energy from the liquid potential energy
(|subtract_values|) and adding the :math:`RT` term (|add_values|). Uncertainties are propagated through the subtraction
by the normal means using the `uncertainties <https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/>`_ package.

""""""""""""""""""

The enthalpy of mixing :math:`\Delta H_{mix}\left(x_0, \cdots, x_{M-1}\right)` for a system of :math:`M` components
is computed according to

"""""""""""""""""""

Solvation Free Energies
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Solvation free energies are currently computed using the `Yank <http://getyank.org/>`_ free energy package using direct
molecular simulations. By default the calculations attempt to use 2000 solvent molecules, and the alchemical lambda
spacings are selected using the built-in 'trailblazing' algorithm.

See the Yank documentation for more details.
