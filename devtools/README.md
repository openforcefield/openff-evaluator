# Development, testing, and deployment tools

This directory contains a collection of tools for running Continuous Integration (CI) tests, 
conda installation, and other development tools not directly related to the coding process.


## Manifest

### Conda Environment:

This directory contains the files to setup the Conda environment for testing purposes

* `conda-envs`: directory containing the YAML file(s) which fully describe Conda Environments, their dependencies, and those dependency provenance's
  * `test_env.yaml`: Simple test environment file with base dependencies. Channels are not specified here and therefore respect global Conda configuration
