    This server is responsible for receiving estimation requests from the client,
    determining which calculation layer to use to launch the request, and

    Notes
    -----
    Every client request is split into logical chunk batches. This enables batches
    of related properties (e.g. all properties for CO) to be estimated in one go
    (or one task graph in the case of workflow based layers) and returned when ready,
    rather than waiting for the full data set to complete.

    Examples
    --------
    Setting up a general server instance using a dask based calculation backend,
    and a local file storage backend:

    >>> # Create the backend which will be responsible for distributing the calculations
    >>> from openff.evaluator.backends.dask import DaskLocalCluster
